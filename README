Standard-project is a basic set of extensions to sbt to codify best practices.

- Include standard maven repos
- Simplify publishing to svn-based repositories
- Create a "build.properties" file in finished products
- Fix local & remote repos to be "maven-style" so transitive dependencies work
- FreeMarker source preprocessing (from github.com/debasishg/sjson)
- Adds rules like:
  - "package-dist" -- build a deployable zip file with included config & scripts
  - "publish-release" -- atomically bump version number & deploy
